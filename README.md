# Get to Philosophy
*Finding philosophy*

### Project Description
This project is inspired by the tooltip text of this xkcd comic: http://xkcd.com/903/

Write a program that takes in a Wikipedia page and follows the first link on the page until it reaches the Wikipedia page for the Philosophy article. The program should list out each hop it takes and print out the total number of hops at the end.
